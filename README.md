This is a simple osquery tls server, for use wherever.  It requires postgresql somewhere, with a table you create yourself, and a functioning elasticsearch for dumping the logs into.

It's functionality is driven by our business need, but features can be requested as issues on github.com/pubkraal/ostls.
